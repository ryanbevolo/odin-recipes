    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Take everything everyone loves about lasagna, make it weeknight fast and easy, 
        and you've got this baked ravioli casserole! Instead of slow-simmering a sauce,
        boiling noodles, and layering again and again, this casserole recipe takes every 
        clever shortcut. The best hack of the bunch? Frozen ravioli! They're already 
        filled with spinach and ricotta (two lasagna layers in one) and bake up 
        beautifully when tossed in meat sauce and topped with shredded mozzarella. 
        Make this dish the breakout star of your favorite Italian dinners—it'll rank 
        right up there with chicken parm, fettuccine alfredo, and yes, even lasagna!

            <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>28 oz. crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>15 oz. crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tsp. Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more for pasta water</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 c. chopped fresh basil, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1/4 c. chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>22 oz. frozen cheese and spinach ravioli</li>
            <li>12 oz. mozzarella cheese, shredded, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 c. grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and 
            onion; cook, stirring often, until the onion is softened, about 6 minutes.
            Add the ground beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until beef is browned, 
            6 to 8 minutes. Drain off the fat, leaving a bit behind for flavor and 
            moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and
            pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to maintain and 
            gentle simmer, and cook 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove 
            from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375°. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season 
            well with salt. Cook the ravioli according to package directions, then 
            drain. Toss the cooked ravioli with 2 cups of the meat sauce in a large 
            bowl. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread 1 cup of the sauce in the bottom of a lightly greased 9-by-13-inch casserole dish. 
            Arrange half of the ravioli in the dish, overlapping slightly. Spoon half of the 
            remaining meat sauce over the top of the ravioli. Top with 2 cups of the mozzarella 
            and 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with the basil and parsley.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange the remaining half of the ravioli on top of the cheese layer, 
            overlapping slightly. Top with remaining meat sauce, 1 cup mozzarella, 
            and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until bubbly. Let 
            stand 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with additional chopped fresh 
            basil and parsley, if you like, before serving.
