        <ol>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. salted butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 oz. fettuccine, broken into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 c. broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 c. chopped cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1/4 c. fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 c. grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Melt the butter in a 
            medium Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic 
            and cook until sizzling, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour and 
            stir to coat the vegetables. Cook, stirring, until the coating is
            smooth but not browned, about 2 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken broth, heavy cream, 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the 
            pot, and stir to combine. Adjust the heat so the soup is simmering and cook 
            until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, add the fettuccine to the boiling water and cook until just 
            al dente, 6 to 7 minutes, adding the broccoli to the pot in the last 
            3 minutes of cooking. Drain well, then stir the pasta and broccoli 
            into the soup along with the chicken. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the soup to a simmer and heat the chicken through, about 2 minutes.
            Stir in the parsley. Remove from the heat and stir in the parmesan and 
            lemon juice; sprinkle with red pepper flakes, if desired. 
        </li>
    </ol>
