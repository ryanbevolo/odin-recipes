    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either 
        the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish 
        made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other 
        ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna 
        noodles.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cans (14.5 ounce) whole tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried basil</li>
            <li>3 c. lowfat cottage cheese</li>
            <li>2 whole beaten eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 package (10 ounces) lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, 
            sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. 
            Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, 
            tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. 
            After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 
            minutes while you are working on the other steps.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 
            2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together 
            well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the 
            boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” 
            (not overly cooked). Drain. 
        </li>
        <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom 
            of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the 
            cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. 
            Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. 
            Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over 
            the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle 
            top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 
            350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
